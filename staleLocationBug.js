In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the `location` object directly within a component often leads to unexpected behavior.  The `location` object is not directly available as a prop and accessing it via `useLocation()` hook outside of a route's `children` results in stale values or unexpected updates.  The problem is exacerbated when dealing with dynamic routes or nested routing.  For instance, if a component is rendered outside a route or the route doesn't update properly, the location may be outdated, causing unexpected rendering or behavior.
